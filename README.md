# Predicting Restaurant Tips Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to apply **Linear Regression** to predict restaurant tips using the popular **Seaborn `tips` dataset**.  
It covers **data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation** — ideal for showcasing fundamental **machine learning and data analysis** skills.

> **Note:** This is a **learning project** completed as part of the **Pytopia course**.  
> All credits for the learning material and guidance go to **Pytopia**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Explored and visualized the `tips` dataset to identify patterns and relationships.
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing features for regression.
- Built a **Linear Regression model** from scratch and using **scikit-learn**.
- Analyzed **model coefficients and intercept** to understand feature importance.
- Evaluated the model using **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
